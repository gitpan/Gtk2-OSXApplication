Gtk2-OSXApplication version 0.01
================================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION
************

This README assumes you have used a jhbuild environment to build Gtk2 on 
your OSX box (I did it on my OS X Lion box with perl 5.12). I also
assume you build the perl Gtk2 modules using prefix PREFIX=~/gtk/inst

To install this module type the following:

   jhbuild shell
   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/gtk/inst
   make
   make test
   make install
   exit
